# calculator

This project is partially complete.

My plan to complete the calculator was to create a InputOutput class which will be responsible for reading the file as a string and outputing the answer to the terminal.

Given more time I would add interfaces around the classes.

The app will not crash if given an incorrect string has been passed, however I would like to add some error messages around these.
